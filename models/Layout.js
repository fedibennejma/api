// cache data array later?

// theme contains layouts (Title slide / title + header etc..)
// we apply a layout to a slide which means we copy the elements of the layout onto the elements of the slide OR we do we just apply the color schemes
// and position of each element? The problem with this second approch is that newly added elements (in the layout) won't be rendered.
// OR... we could make a mix of the two? Make a colorScheme for title/subtitle etc and add elements array for newly added elements that are unchanged and we render the√π as a background
// The layout schema is applied to a slide. But it's not related to it by keys, we just take the info from here and apply them to our slide's elements
// If we have some elements in a slide and we apply a layout, we override our positions by the layout ones, but once we change a theme, we keep the positions
// of the important elements (title, subtilte, content, images etc) while the other elements are overriden
